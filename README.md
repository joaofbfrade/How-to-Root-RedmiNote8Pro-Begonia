Root-Redmi-note-8-Pro
All tutorials are outdated and since i only found 1 recovery image firmware that worked on this device:

1.Unlock xiaomi with miunlock, you need to add your miui account connect and wait 1 week before you do

2.Connect your phone to Pc and go fastboot mode, if its not detected you need to updat your fastboot drivers

3.Run TWRP autoinstaller to change the recovery Image firmware

4.Install MagiskManager to root device


optional ( To run apps that dont allow you to use rooted device like Banking apps : Revolut, Stripe, etc... ) install Shamiko module => hide magisk and add the app you want to hidding list.

Done
